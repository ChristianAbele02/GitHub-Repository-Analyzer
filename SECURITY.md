# Security and Functional Issues Policy for GitHub Repository Analyzer

**Maintainer:** Christian Abele 
**Last Updated:** 02 June 2025

## About This Policy
Hi! I'm a solo developer maintaining the GitHub Repository Analyzer project. This document explains how I handle both security vulnerabilities and functional issues. Please read this before reporting any problems.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What I Consider Security Issues
- 🔴 **Critical**: API token leaks, remote code execution, data breaches
- 🟠 **High**: Authentication flaws, privilege escalation, data leaks
- 🟡 **Medium**: DoS risks, insecure defaults, major misconfigurations
- 🔵 **Low**: Minor info leaks, deprecated dependency warnings

### How to Report
**Never post security issues publicly!** Instead:

1. **Email me**: christian.abele@uni-bielefeld.de with "[SECURITY] GitHub Analyzer" in subject
2. **Use GitHub's private reporting**: Via the "Security" tab
3. **Include**:
   - Exact steps to reproduce
   - Impact description
   - Suggested fix (if known)
   - Your contact info

### My Response Promise
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial analysis within 7 business days
- **Updates**: Every 2 weeks until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**:
  - Critical: Within 14 days
  - High: Within 30 days
  - Medium/Low: Next major release

## Reporting Functional Issues

### Types of Functional Problems
- 💥 **Crashes**: App won't start or crashes consistently
- 📉 **Data Issues**: Wrong analysis results, missing data
- 🖥️ **Visualization Errors**: Charts not rendering properly
- 🐢 **Performance**: Unusually slow operations
- 📚 **Documentation**: Missing/confusing instructions

### How to Report
Use GitHub Issues with these templates:

```markdown
## What```broken
[Clear description]

## Steps to```produce

3. 

##```pected vs Actual```pected: 
Actual: 

## My```vironment
- OS```- Python: 
- Analy``` Version: 
```

### My Triage Process
- **Critical Bugs**: Fix within 7 days
- **Major Bugs**: Fix in next minor release
- **Minor Bugs**: Batch fix quarterly
- **Documentation**: Update within 14 days

## Feature Requests
_I welcome ideas but can't promise implementation:_

1. Open a GitHub Issue with "[FEATURE]" prefix
2. Explain:
   - Problem it solves
   - Suggested approach
   - Similar projects' implementations

## My Development Rhythm
As a solo developer:
- 🕒 **Work Hours**: Evenings and weekends (UTC+1)
- 🚀 **Release Cycle**:
  - Patch Releases: Weekly (critical fixes only)
  - Minor Releases: Monthly
  - Major Releases: Quarterly
- 📅 **Roadmap**: Updated quarterly in ROADMAP.md

## Security Best Practices for Users
To protect yourself while using my tool:

1. 🔑 **Token Safety**
```python
# Always```e environment```riables
import os```ken = os.environ.get('G```UB_TOKEN') ```Never hard```e!
```

2. 🛡️ **Configuration**
- Validate all user inputs
- Run in isolated environments
- Review dependency changes

3. 📁 **Data Handling**
- Regularly purge old analyses
- Encrypt sensitive results
- Audit export files

## What I Need From You
- Clear reproduction steps
- Error logs (use code blocks!)
- Patience - I'm human 🧑💻
- Respectful communication

## My Commitments to You
1. I'll never ignore valid security reports
2. I'll credit your contributions (unless anonymous)
3. I'll maintain transparency about limitations
4. I'll document all known issues in KNOWN_ISSUES.md

## Legal Protection
By reporting issues responsibly:
- You agree not to exploit vulnerabilities
- I won't pursue legal action for good-faith reports
- We both commit to ethical disclosure
